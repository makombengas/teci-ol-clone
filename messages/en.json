      "secondTitle": "In 10-minute conversations, 12 students exchanged ideas with 12 IT employers from Oldenburg. The discussions focused on possible collaboration, whether for an internship, a working student position, or practical supervision of a bachelor‚Äôs or master‚Äôs thesis. After 10 minutes, the egg timer rang, and the seats and conversation partners were rotated. The IT network TECI_OL organized the speed-dating event at Schlauen Haus and coordinated participating companies with the aim of retaining well-qualified young professionals from regional universities and showing young people good career opportunities. Mike Wilkes from open knowledge, who coordinated the project for TECI_OL, said: ‚ÄúEvents like these already exist at some universities ‚Äì including the University of Oldenburg. They are based on the dating format for singles looking for partners. However, this particular IT speed-dating event has never been held in Oldenburg before in this form.‚Äù",

      "thirdSubtitle": "Solveig Elias, from the Central Study and Career Counseling (ZSKB) at the University of Oldenburg, Department 3, coordinated the registration process for the event and later exchanged contact information in case of a match. ‚ÄúWe deliberately refrained from providing company representatives with information about the students beforehand. We want the encounters to start unprejudiced and give everyone an equal chance to impress during the conversation,‚Äù emphasized Solveig Elias. She specifically invited students from the master's or higher semesters of bachelor's programs in computer science, business informatics, mathematics, neuroscience, and engineering physics at the University of Oldenburg. The 12 students eagerly changed places every 10 minutes and started a new conversation. Naturally, it was exhausting for all participants ‚Äì including the company representatives ‚Äì as concentration was required, but it was also all the more successful. The positive feedback from students ranged from ‚Äúa great overview of IT employers in the region‚Äù to ‚Äúa ray of hope in the dark jungle of job applications‚Äù and ‚Äúa great opportunity to explore whether a career in IT is possible in a straightforward way.‚Äù At the end of the speed-dating event, both the students and the IT employers indicated which contacts they would like to deepen. Many connections were made ‚Äì matches between students and IT companies ‚Äì which will now be networked by the Central Study and Career Counseling at the university. The great success speaks for itself, making it clear that while this was the first, it certainly won‚Äôt be the last IT speed-dating event organized by the TECI_OL network.",
